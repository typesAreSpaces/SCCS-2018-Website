	  <h2>Submission Format</h2>
	  <h3>Research Talks</h3>
	  <p>Submissions should have an abstract of 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. The submission should be between 6 to 10 pages long (including references). The submission must contain a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including discussion of its importance, prior work, and an outline (similar to a brief oral presentation) of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. The submission should include all of the ideas necessary for an expert to verify fully the central claims in the paper. Finally, the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of computer scientists, not solely to experts in the subarea. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission.</p>
	  <p>The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, double column including figures, tables and references in standard ACM format. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
